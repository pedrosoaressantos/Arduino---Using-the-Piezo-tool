// In this Level, we are just testing the circuit architecture
// and testing it's funcionality with a given code in the PDF file


int buzzerPin = 5 ; //The buzzerPin is connected to pin 5 of the Arduino.
int button1Pin = 2; //The SW1 button is connect to pin 2 of the Arduino.
void setup() { //The Setup function runs once.
pinMode(buzzerPin, OUTPUT); //Setup red LED pin as an output pin.
pinMode(button1Pin, INPUT); //Setup button1 pin as an input pin.
}
void loop() { //The loop function runs forever.
if (digitalRead(button1Pin) == HIGH) { //Check to see if button1 is pressed.
tone(buzzerPin, 1000,50); //Play a tone of 1000Hz for 50milliseconds.
}
}

// End of Level 1
